**Don't want to buy all of the parts and laser cut them yourself? Buy the [Optimist kit from the Scoutbots' store](http://scoutbots.com/products/protei-011-optimist-kit).**

## How does the Optimist work?

**Add high level information on how the curved hull works.**

See the research part of the wiki for the specifics on why the curving hull is used.

## Tools and skills needed

**What tools and skills are needed to build the boat?**

## Laser cutting

Laser cut all hull and acrylic pieces using the following files:

* `20140501_optimiste_acrylic_3mm.dxf`
* `20140501_optimiste_joint_deck.dxf`
* `20140501_optimiste_laser.skp`

## Dry box build intstructions

The dry box is where all of the electronic components will be to control the sail and the curved hull.

**What are the steps to build the dry box with electronics?**


## RC setup

**Do you need to configure the RC transmitter?**

## Boat build instructions

In this part, we explain you how to launch protei 11.1 by setting up electronic, the system direction which controls the shifting hull and finally the rigging.

### Electronics

Remove the dry box and open it to switch on the batteries.

Put the dry box in the boat and screw it with the 4 ear nuts.

### Wheel for direction

Remove the wheel by unscrewing the small screw. Attach the two ropes on the wheel with the two pins : one rope on the first level and the other on the second level.

### Lines

Make two turns with the line of the upper level in clockwise and two turns with the bottom line in the opposite way (counterclockwise) that the upper line. Then, thread the line in the small plastic tubes. Ropes of each level is for on side of the boat.

### Knots

Now, thread all the ropes in the loops on the deck. And attach the ropes on the bow and on the stern. Make sure that there is enough tension on the lines to prevent them from tangling at the level of the wheel. Even, when you attach one rope, you can (as in the bottom right picture) curve a tiny bit the hull of on side. The other line will make up for this curve.

### Rigging

Now, you have just to set up the rigging and your boat will be ready to go sailing! Start by putting the mast in the foot mast and finish by connecting the mast at the servomotor arm.

### Testing

**How do we test to make sure that it was assembled properly?**

### Done!

And your boat is ready to go in the water!
